[Shelved for now - ready for pickup by anyone willing to give it a try - Will try again when I hopefully have spare time]

Use with https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/download/v6.0.0-pre.2/BepInEx-Unity.IL2CPP-win-x64-6.0.0-pre.2.zip

- Setup BepinEx and put the .dll file into the "plugins" folder.

Source code included. 

F1 changes the PC's gender at any point during gameplay.

Hiccups here and there but most things work. 
Was unable to locate the method for pregnancy (well, kinda but not entirely, some flag/condition is missing for it to actually be registered event though the PC is marked as pregnant). 

Check my code to see my attempts to solve this. I deleted some of them, but I tried at least 50+ candidate methods. Anyone with more skilled than I am (and I'm not very skilled) should be able to finish it properly.
